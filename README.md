# TimeSheets_Threat-Model

## Scenario
Your company utilizes a custom application, called TimeSheets, to log timesheets. This custom application was built in-house. Until recently, this application was only accessible via the internal corporate network. Due to an increasingly mobile workforce, the need to access the application externally has started to increase. Business leaders made the suggestion of using the existing application and exposing it externally. Last week, IT made the change to allow users to connect externally.

Shortly after exposing TimeSheets externally, the IT and security operations teams began noticing odd behavior related to TimeSheets. IT has seen a significant amount of users reporting incorrect data in the system. The security operations center has noticed logins from unexpected locations and unexpected times. After raising an incident, it was determined that unauthorized logins were occurring.

After resolving the incident, your team was asked to come in and assess the application and provide recommendations. A senior security engineer from your team completed the initial threat model related to the incident. During the threat model, your colleague discovered the root cause for the incident as well as several other vulnerabilities - all of which are related to encryption. Due to other obligations, your colleague has asked you to complete their work.
